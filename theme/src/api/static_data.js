  <em>Wuhan2020</em>
</a>, our parent project. Without the calling of the Wuhan2020 open source
community, we could not manage to unite so many people.
</p>
<p>
However, we are an independent working group under the data science team. Our implicit goal is to open research and
open data, to make utilize of our knowledge and skills, even under urgent circumstances. The parent project is of
significant importance but almost failed to support the emerging research needs, so here comes our destiny.
</p>
<p>
Everyone here worth to be mentioned. We are sorry if someone's name accidentally was not on the board, your
contribution won't be neglected. If you have any questions or would like to change your name listed below, please
